# Dictionaries, they should be formatted like this:
programming_dictionary = {
    "Bug": "An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected.", 
    "Function": "A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.",
}

# This code below will print the definition of bug, you use the key to print the value it is paired with.
print(programming_dictionary["Bug"])
