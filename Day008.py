greet(my_name, my_birthday, my_age) # when calling a function that has parameters, arguments are expected, these can use variables or hard coded data
# note that the arguments name does not have to match the paramenter name, but whatever is in the parentheses will be used as the argument.

# The above are referred to as positional arguements, as the order they are type in is important, name must be first then birthday, then age
# is i mixed these up they would print out in the wrong order, hence positional

greet(birthday=my_birthday, age=my_age, name=my_name) #when doing key pairs like this, avoid spaces while assigning, good practice.

# above is the other version of arguments called keyword arguments, i take the name of the parameter, then assign the argument to it
# i can now assign all my arguments to the parameters names in any order i wish.
# as you can see above the argments are not in the correct order, but are paired with the parameter names.
